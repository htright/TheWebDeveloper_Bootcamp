    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> junglefowl species, with attributes of
        wild species such
        as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
        for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p> An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
        hen.[11][12]

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        Chick: a young chicken[15]
        Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
        Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
        Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
        Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
        Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
        Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as
        a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification]

        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]</p>

        The mythological basilisk or cockatrice is depicted as a reptile-like creature with the upper body of a
        rooster.[119][120] Abraxas, a figure in Gnosticism, is portrayed in a similar fashion as well.[121]

        In Greek mythology, Alectryon was a young man that Ares put as a guardian outside his door to inform him if
        anybody came near while he was making love to Aphrodite, who was married to Hephaestus, Ares' brother. But
        Alectryon fell asleep while on guard, so Helios, the sun, saw the two lovers and alerted Hephaestus. In anger
        over Alectryon's incompetence, Ares turned him into a rooster, a bird that always crows at dawn when the sun is
        about to rise, still loyal to their promise to Ares.[122][123] The rooster was thus one of Helios' sacred
        animals.[124]
